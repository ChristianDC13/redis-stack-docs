The Slow Log tool displays the list of logs captured by the `SLOWLOG` command, which allows you to analyze all commands that exceed a specified runtime and helps you troubleshoot performance issues. Specify both the runtime and the maximum length of Slowlog (which are server configurations) to configure the list of commands logged and set the auto-refresh interval to automatically update the list of commands displayed.

The Slow Log tool displays the list of logs captured by the `SLOWLOG` command to analyze all commands that exceed a specified runtime, which helps with troubleshooting performance issues. Specify both the runtime and the maximum length of Slowlog (which are server configurations) to configure the list of commands logged and set the auto-refresh interval to automatically update the list of commands displayed.

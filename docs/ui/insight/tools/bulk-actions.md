Easily and quickly delete multiple keys of the same type and/or with the same key name pattern in bulk. To do so, in the List or Tree view, set filters per key type or key names and open the Bulk Actions section. The section displays a summary of all the keys with the expected number of keys that will be deleted based on the set filters.

When the bulk deletion is completed, RedisInsight displays the results of this operation with the number of keys processed and the time taken to delete the keys in bulk.
Use bulk deletion to optimize the usage of your database based on the results from the Redis database analysis.

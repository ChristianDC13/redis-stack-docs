Browser offers [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) support for lists, hashes, strings, sets, sorted sets, streams, as well as for [RedisJSON](/docs/stack/json).

* Browse, filter, and visualize your key-value Redis data structures. 

* Group keys according to their namespaces.

* View, validate, and manage your key values in a human-readable format using formatters that prettify and highlight data in different formats (for example, Unicode, JSON, MessagePack, HEX, and ASCII) in the Browser tool.

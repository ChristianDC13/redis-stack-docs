## Contributing to Redis

There are many ways to contribute to Redis, starting with documentation all the way to changes to the open source Redis server. Here are a few ways you can get involved.

## Contributing to docs

The Redis docs are open source, and we'd love to have your contributions. For small changes and typos, we recommend creating a pull request against redis-doc repo.

## Reporting bugs

To report a bug in Redis, create a Redis Github issue


For larger doc changes, we ask that you first create an issue to make the maintainers aware of your proposed changes.

## Client libraries

The client libraries for Redis are nearly always open source and accepting of contributions.
